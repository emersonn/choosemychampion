              <p>
                Have you ever had that moment where you're in champion select and you're just clicking through champions
                wondering what to play? We've all had that moment. Maybe you've had that moment where you've been wondering if
                playing Fizz mid has really been working out for you. Has it? Is it the best champion to play for you? Or is there
                something better that you can just wreck some face with. Choose My Champion is here to help!
              </p>

              <h5 class="info-text">How does this all work?</h5>

              <p>
                Choose My Champion takes match histories of thousands upon thousands of players and looks for the champions that
                seem to be performing well <i>right now</i>. It takes all of this data, compiles a ton of statistics, and most importantly
                compiles statistics of <strong>you, the player</strong> to find which champion is the best for you to play.
              </p>

              <h5 class="info-text">What does the "champion score" mean?</h5>

              <p>
                It is a huge number of things. Just a few things include the ability for the champion to get towers, the kda
                of the champion, and how well the champion performs against the current meta. There are so many more factors that go
                into the champion score that it's hard to list them all off!

                Hi! I'm Emerson Matson, a Chemistry and Computer Science student at the University of Washington. I work hard to help
                create fun and unique experiences for people through the form of cool little applications that I work on in my spare time.

              <p>
                Remade the whole website from the ground up. Data collection and retrieval has been
                improved immensely and adding new features should be a lot more straightforward. Player
                data is now more extensive and should be a lot more accurate and helpful.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Redesign of the website has lightened some of the load and definitely is a lot cleaner and
                  nicer to look at. So pretty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multiple region support! Yay for being worldly!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Player data should now be reset with a very short time frame now, so there is no need to worry
                  worry about playing a ton of ranked matches and having to reset your data. It should reset automagically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cool new graphs and information have been added for detailed champion statistics. Although there
                  are plans to expand this further this is only the beginning!
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are so many more huge changes and features that are hard to list out. You'll definitely
                  notice them as you're using the new remade site.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Thought we could have a #tbt with a screenshot.</p>
