          <h5 class="info-text">What is this about?</h5>

          <p>
            Have you ever had that moment where you're in champion select and you're just clicking through champions
            wondering what to play? We've all had that moment. Maybe you've had that moment where you've been wondering if
            playing Fizz mid has really been working out for you. Has it? Is it the best champion to play for you? Or is there
            something better that you can just wreck some face with. Choose My Champion is here to help!
          </p>

          <h5 class="info-text">How does this all work?</h5>

          <p>
            Choose My Champion takes match histories of thousands upon thousands of players and looks for the champions that
            seem to be performing well <i>right now</i>. It takes all of this data, compiles a ton of statistics, and most importantly
            compiles statistics of <strong>you, the player</strong> to find which champion is the best for you to play.
          </p>

          <h5 class="info-text">What does the "champion score" mean?</h5>

          <p>
            It is a huge number of things. Just a few things include the ability for the champion to get towers, the kda
            of the champion, and how well the champion performs against the current meta. There are so many more factors that go
            into the champion score that it's hard to list them all off!

            Hi! I'm Emerson Matson, a Chemistry and Computer Science student at the University of Washington. I work hard to help
            create fun and unique experiences for people through the form of cool little applications that I work on in my spare time.
          </p>

          <h5 class="info-text">I have a suggestion!</h5>

          <p>
            I will get a more stable way to communicate with me, but for now send me an email at
            <a>emersonn@cs.washington.edu</a>.
