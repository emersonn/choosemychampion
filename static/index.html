          <h4>
            Wait, tell me again, what does this do?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We've all had that moment. We are never sure what to play until the clock hits 10 seconds. Kind of
            freak out a <i>little</i> bit and then we pick some randy champion that we <i>think</i> might be able to do well with.
            But, we're never quite sure because sometimes we get absolutely destroyed. Why not let the computer
            help us decide the best champion to play, because winning is the only thing that counts... Right? Right?
          </p>
          <h4>
            How does this work?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Well, long story short, the system gathers not only your play information but gathers information of tons
            of other players' results. Using the mighty power of statistics, and a bit of
            magic, you are presented with a list of champions for each role ordered by a <strong>champion
              score</strong>.
            </p>
            <h4>
              What does this champion score represent?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The champion score encompasses a lot of things. From the actual win rate of the champion, the pick rate of the
              champion, to even the ability for the champion to acquire objectives. Most importantly the champion score also
              includes an adjustment that represents the champions compatibility with you!
            </p>
            <h4>
              I'm getting an error, try again later message!
            </h4>
            <p>
              Something must have gone wrong! There are two possible reasons for this: you may have typed in the wrong summoner
              name! If the typo'd summoner name didn't exist the system will go crazy and go kaput. Just kidding, it would
              just say there's an error since it couldn't find it. Another reason for this is that the system is currently
              overloaded. It automatically tries to reconnect and pull your data, but sometimes those retries may not always
              work, also! Try again in a minute or two.
            </p>
