Project #2: League Champion Suggestion System (LCSS) LEL
  > Technologies to use: Flask (maybe Django), Ember, Foundations, SASS (gulp.js)
                         SQL Alchemy?, Colorama hehe, Statistics, Scipy
  > The page takes a user name, their role (top lane, mid lane...),
    and maybe what role they are trying to fill (optional)?
    > They are given a main champion and the ranking of the champion
      supported with win rate data, their win rate data, and the ranking
      of the champion. Link to guides? Affiliate links?
  > How does this work?
    > WORKING database would be updated twice weekly...
      > These would be updated with win rates of particular champions
        in solo queue, also in particular roles.
      > Would have to integrate what role they're trying to fill and
        the current team status? What their team needs? This would be good
        to know because they might need a tank...?
    > Algorithim would take the working database (updated nightly)
      > The algorithim would then update the current RANKINGS of
        particular champions based on win rates and also multiple other
        sources from things such as nerfplz.com, or other tier lists.
      > The champions would be put into point rankings for particular
        listings such as top lane, mid lane, bottom lane...
      > Maybe the person can just put in their name? Top lane, bottom lane
        etc would be put into different tabs?
    > The person's data can be gathered from multiple sources...
      > League's servers, LOLKing, or op.gg
        > Avoid overloading League's servers and would have to
          aggregate own data and make ranking of each champion
          for that particular person...
        > LolKing would give aggregated data and op.gg too.....
      > After the person's data is gathered (maybe stored in database?)
        > They are deleted every week if not updated?
        > Their rankings are then put into each ranking individually. These
          would simply update the point rankings of singular champions
          to allow more customized data.
    > Updated data flow: Weekly request night -> .py file that runs this in console
      -> gets champion data from League (maybe 1000 seed matches) -> aggregates
      data and puts point values to champions in certain roles -> crawls web for
      opinions and FOTMS and champions that might be good maybe some input crawler
      for nerfplz.com -> generates a table of champion, and top lane, mid lane and
      bottom lane values -> user request -> generate user champion table and adjust
      values in the database after retrieved -> give data back
    > Champion -> Meta (could be multiple) -> Their Point Value
      > Factors for consideration:
        ban rate (good), win rate (good), pick rate (medium, could be not good to play
        if everyone plays the champion so they know how to pick against, maybe look
        at top counter picks?)
    > Crawling
      > Go to featured game, go 10 players deep, then take another featured game
        then go ten players deep, to 100,000 players
      > Go to featured game and then increment match to go to a solo queue game
        then go from there. (/observer-mode/rest/featured)
    > from time import sleep
    > Counter picking, team composition
    > later, the data can be used to analyze a person's play style in ranked and how
      they can become better. like what role are they playing? is their CS good at certain
      times? what about their K/d/A? etc.....
  > Display of the page
    > Silvery overlay of champion splash arts? Glass over the
      art and maybe dark black League page for actual input.
      Maybe look at the League pages, such as the League Fantasy
      or maybe surr at 20 site.
    > Gold trims? Good custom backgrounds? White page on glassy? Look at
      dribbble and saved photos and favorited photos. Good UI to look at.
    > Customize Foundations before using it!

Work flow: crawler.py -> analyze.py -> adjustment.py

> / -> /username/ -> /username/top/ /username/mid/ -> /username/top/Akali/ (expanded)
> maybe in list format. when they request lists come up with top mid jungle, etc...
> then more nested lists.

> / has a form where the user inputs their username
> it transitionsTo or link-to the URL corresponding to their username

> /username/ then sets its model or uses some type of EmberData to get their information from
> the server at /username/. somehow i need to tell the difference between an AJAX request
> and their /username/ that they want originally. or maybe just /api/username/

> now their browser has all the data they need so they can navigate between
> the top lane, mid lane, and the champion names.

> todo at the moment: go through all the todos. (for later) github this. (fixed) implement all the
> "minificiation" techniques and clean up all code! (fixed) use dependency downloaders
> such as bower and stuff! (for later)

> lightweight analytics? FAVICON! (done) compress CSS and JS ensure cache management
> is correct and fine. (?)

> cool data visualization with lots of champion data and interactive data? (for later)

> need to encode the username! usernames with spaces are not working! (fixed) fix the email link?
> maybe make it a more private email? (fixed)

> settings files and decomposing some extra code (fixed), add ssh key to webfaction and sshkey from webfaction to git. (done)

> set up memcached on the server. migrate current db on my side to mysql. Live statistics of how many matches
> or champions have been recorded. (done) set up database backups. consider next month moving to digitalocean. need
> to consider moving database, and also the settings files. everything else should git pull fine.

> donâ€™t push settings files, don't push database files! and then do git pull
> database: tartio/soup12

> update all the data on the server now! try to adjust the adjustment so it's more weighted, raise the
> expected win rates. wins under 20 minutes? damage and meta? cs numbers and economy of items

> indepth champion details. could show user data could not? shows the champion profile and more details statistics
> about that champion in particular? could navigate to a new page or could open under that particular
> champion. it would be easier to make a new page while putting under the champion would be easier for users.
> could show statistics about that champion over time from win rates. pick rates of that champion over time.
> show the score values over time? would cause need to have historical data for scores? show the user's
> champion data.

> also comment on all new things. need to fix IE stuff. all the /stats/reset stuff too! clarify it's based on a 100 pt scale. weight played champions more
> maybe give featured champions esp. rising new stars (highlighted in yellow borders and a star) and maybe maybe something they've never
> played before! also keep in mind champions they may not have

> keep in mind champion skill levels. reksai harder to play but vi easier to pick up and win with in which
> win rates may not relate too. green to red skill bar. the score count is gold for champion score and
> added on top is the adjustment. hardest champs for a particular champ. optional include of other seasons and normal games.

> todo list:
> adjust the adjustment and expected win rate to be more favorable to played champions
> wins under 20 minutes? damage and meta? cs numbers and economy of items?
> comment on all new things

> fix IE stuff
> set up database backups
> memcached?

> migrate current database on local side to mysql (not done but workaround)
> implement /stats/reset (implemented w/out creating new data)
> implement a reset button (AJAX to reset and once complete reload the data) (added)
> make the settings page nicer
> make the reset button not delete things but just edit the availability of data

> featured champions, rising new stars, and random suggested champs

> extra page for champion data
> champion skill level
> data visualization and interactive data

> go through all the todos in the code!

> optional other seasons and normal games

> dependency downloaders?
> digitalocean?
