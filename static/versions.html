          <p>
            Sorry for the long wait for the newest update everyon! This update really consists of a lot of backend fixes
            that really simplifies a lot of work on this part of the app that would make adding new features really
            easy and would break less as the app starts getting more complex. Furthermore I have fixed EUW players' problems!
            Yay! I'm so sorry that has taken so long. Continue letting me know any comments, suggestions, or things that
            may be broken!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Improved performance of counters/assists and detailed champion statistics. Now it shouldn't take entirely forever
              in order to find more details about the champions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed major bug with data collection. More stable numbers for win rates, and all other statistics, and by relation
              the point values for particular champions.
            </li>
            <li>
              EUW has been fixed! Finally! I believe all other international servers should also work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Made about and version history pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Added a quick notes section. It gives a lot of personal advice to playing the right champion in a more detailed manner
              than just statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lots and lots of improvement on the backend.
            </li>

            Remade the whole website from the ground up. Data collection and retrieval has been
            improved immensely and adding new features should be a lot more straightforward. Player
            data is now more extensive and should be a lot more accurate and helpful.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Redesign of the website has lightened some of the load and definitely is a lot cleaner and
              nicer to look at. So pretty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multiple region support! Yay for being worldly!
            </li>
            <li>
              Player data should now be reset with a very short time frame now, so there is no need to worry
              worry about playing a ton of ranked matches and having to reset your data. It should reset automagically.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cool new graphs and information have been added for detailed champion statistics. Although there
              are plans to expand this further this is only the beginning!
            </li>
            <li>
              There are so many more huge changes and features that are hard to list out. You'll definitely
              notice them as you're using the new remade site.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Thought we could have a #tbt with a screenshot.</p>
